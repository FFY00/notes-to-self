      <description>&lt;p&gt;I manage two classrooms with 40 dual boot Windows Server and Linux (Fedora) computers. In our Windows Server course, the idea is to teach students to work with Hyper-V, but other courses taught in the same classroom usually use VirtualBox. Unfortunately, Hyper-V and VirtualBox (or any other virtualization platform for that matter) don&amp;rsquo;t coexist. The easy solution was not to install VirtualBox. It&amp;rsquo;s unconvenient, but students that need VirtualBox could boot into Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a few weeks ago, one of my students ran into a similar problem: he has Hyper-V installed on his laptop and also wanted to use VirtualBox for my Linux course. He then let me know that he solved the problem by disabling Hyper-V, something I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize was possible. That made me wonder if there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a solution that I could automate and deploy on all classroom computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I knew where to look, I found a few blog posts (a.o. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2008/04/14/creating-a-no-hypervisor-boot-entry.aspx&#34;&gt;this one by Ben Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;) with instructions to create a new entry in the Windows Boot Manager. All good and well, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do this manually on 40 machines&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went a little further and wrote a PowerShell script that duplicates the boot entry, assigns suitable names to each, turns off Hyper-V in the copy, and made the copy the default one. Now, students that boot into Windows get the choice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes-to-self/img/bootmenu-hyperv-vbox.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Windows boot menu with options Hyper-V and VirtualBox&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the resulting script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34; style=&#34;background: #272822&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;line-height: 125%&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #75715e&#34;&gt;# TODO:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

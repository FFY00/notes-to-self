Hi! My name is Bert Van Vreckem and I teach Linux system administration at [University College Ghent](https://fbo.hogent.be/faculteit/english/).

In this blog, I write about stuff that I learn, about solutions for problems that I encounter, answer great questions from my students (or from you!), etc. Topics include basic system administration (especially everything related to RHEL/CentOS 7 and systemd), shell scripting, configuration management with Ansible, etc.
